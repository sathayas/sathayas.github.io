<p class="noindent">
With some background in brain imaging statistics and network science,
I am interested in analyzing complex network data, often derived from
functional MRI (fMRI). Here are some of the research topics that
I am interested in. </p>


<h3 class="subheading">Explosive percolation</h3>
<p>
I am interested in a statistical mechanics process known as
percolation during network formation. Percolation is a phase transition phenomenon
in which a large connected network (known as the giant component) emerges as
edges are gradually added to a collection of isolated nodes.
If the way we add edges is carefully orchestrated, a giant component
emerges very abruptly, known as explosive percolation. </p>


<h3 class="subheading">Anti-fragmentation</h3>
<p>
  Some complex networks are often formed by thresholding a
  correlation matrix describing association between nodes
  (e.g., gene co-expression networks, fMRI connectivity networks).
  A widely used approach is to apply the same threshold to the entire
  correlation matrix, known as hard thresholding. However,
  hard thresholding often results in fragmented networks with
  a large number of disconnected nodes. One remedy for this problem is
  to threshold each row of the correlation matrix separately.
  This will result in networks with very few disconnected components.
</p>


<h3 class="subheading">fMRI network modules during a task</h3>
<p>
  I am interesting identifying network modules associated with
  a simple fMRI task. A network module is a cluster of nodes that are
  highly interconnected among themselves but only sparsely connected
  to the rest of the network.</p>


<h3 class="subheading">Statistical power calculation in fMRI experiments</h3>
<p>
  In the past, I have developed a theoretical framework, based on
  random field theory, to calculate statistical power for fMRI experiments.
  This has been implemented in a software toolbox in MATLAB.
  Currently I am trying to port this toolbox into Python.</p>
