    I was at the OHBM (Organization for Human Brain Mapping) annual conference 
    in Singapore in June. I presented a poster titled 
    "Anti-fragmentation of resting-state fMRI networks with node-wise thresholding."

  <li class="news"><b>fMRI analysis class for Fall 2018 semester</b> [4/23/2018]
    I will be offering a graduate-level course on fMRI data analysis called
    "Methods for fMRI" (PSY 394U) in Fall 2018 semester. I plan to re-structure the course
    quite a bit, covering new topics such as scripting and pipelines (mostly with NiPype)
    in addition to general topics on fMRI preprocessing / analyses such as registration,
    normalization, study design, GLM, and multiple comparison correction.

  <li class="news"><b>Undergraduate class on intro Python for Fall 2018 semester</b> [4/23/2018]
    My intro Python class will be offered as an undergraduate-level course
    (PSY 341K). It is desinged for students who have never taken a formal programming
    class before, and covers basic programming concepts such as if-else, for loops,
    reading / writing files, and arrays.
  </li>
  <li class="news"><b>Data analytics with Python</b> [2/14/2018]
    My new class on data analytics with Python has started. It focuses on
    non-traditional data analysis techniques such as machine learning,
    network analysis, and text mining.
  </li>
  <li class="news"><b>I have a web site now!</b> [11/17/2017]
    At least the front page, for now. Other pages will go online as soon
    as I finish them.

  <li class="news"><b>A new Python course for Spring 2018 semester</b> [11/9/2017]
    A new class titled "Data Analytics with Python" (PSY 394U) is now
    officially listed. This course is a sequel to my intro Python class,
    and covers various non-traditional data analysis techniques
    (machine learning, network analysis, text mining, etc.) using
    Python.
  </li>
  <li class="news"><b>Paper published in Brain Connectivity</b> [9/12/2017]
    The paper titled "Anti-fragmentation of resting-state fMRI
    connectivity networks with node-wise thresholding" has been
    accepted for publication in Brain Connectivity.
