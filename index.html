  <h4 class="news">fMRI analysis class for Fall 2019 semester [4/17/2019, updated 7/23/2019]</h4>
    <p class="noindent">
    I will be offering a graduate-level course on fMRI data analysis called
    "Methods for fMRI" (PSY 394U) in Fall 2019 semester. I plan to re-re-structure the course
    quite a bit, covering basic concepts and steps of brain imaging data, with emphasis on
    scripting (with Python). We will also cover newer analysis methods based on
    machine learning, such as pattern classification.
    This course is an introductory class, so any graduate students
    interested in brain imaging are welcome to register.

  <h4 class="news">Network neuroscience satellite conference at NetSci2019 [4/17/2019,
    update 5/25/2019]</h4>
    <p class="noindent">
      I will be speaking at a satellite meeting on
      <a href="https://www.netneurosci.com">network neuroscience</a> at NetSci2019
      conference in Burlington, VT this coming May. Codes, data, notes, slides, and some
      figures are available through a <a href='https://github.com/sathayas/NetNeurosci2019'>
      GitHub repository</a>.

  <h4 class="news">Undergraduate Python coding class for Fall 2019 semester [4/17/2019]</h4>
    <p class="noindent">
    Again this year, I will be offering my intro Python class as an undergraduate-level
    course (PSY 341K). It is desinged for students who have never taken a formal programming
    class before, and covers basic programming concepts such as if-else, for loops,
    reading / writing files, and arrays.

  <h4 class="news"> New class: Brain connectivity (PSY 381D) [11/15/2018]</h4>
    <p class="noindent">
    I will be teaching a new class called "Brain connectivity."
    This is an introductory course on network science and brain imaging,
    with some components of <i>hands-on</i> learning. It is designed for
    both quantitative scientists and brain imaging researchers; materials
    are organized in a way that no advanced knowledge in network science or
    brain imaging is required.

  <h4 class="news"> Data analytics with Python (PSY 394U) [11/15/2018]</h4>
    <p class="noindent">
    Data Analytics with Python (PSY 394U) will be offered again in the
    Spring 2019 semester! This is a graduate-level Python course covering
    various non-traditional data analysis techniques (machine learning,
    network analysis, text mining, etc.).
    </p>

  <h4 class="news">Help wanted [8/9/2018]</h4>
    <p class="noindent">
    I have a small programming project for an undergrad for this coming fall semester.
    It involves Python and 3D volume extraction from brain image data. This is part of
    the project to port the fMRI study planning software tool into Python.
    You can find more details at the
    <a href="https://eureka.utexas.edu/project/3d-volume-and-surface-extraction-brain-imaging-data">Eureka website</a>. <br>
    <b><i>Update: The position has already been filled. Thank you very much for your interest</i></b>

    <p class="noindent">
    I was at the OHBM (Organization for Human Brain Mapping) annual conference
    in Singapore in June. I presented a poster titled
    <a href="https://files.aievolution.com/hbm1801/abstracts/31375/2381_Hayasaka.pdf">
    "Anti-fragmentation of resting-state fMRI networks with node-wise thresholding."

    <p class="noindent">
    I will be offering a graduate-level course on fMRI data analysis called
    "Methods for fMRI" (PSY 394U) in Fall 2018 semester. I plan to re-structure the course
    quite a bit, covering new topics such as scripting and pipelines (mostly with NiPype)
    in addition to general topics on fMRI preprocessing / analyses such as registration,
    normalization, study design, GLM, and multiple comparison correction.
